This is a tutorial on how to do Tabs. There has been a little change in how Tabs are made.  You can open the Admin View. In the Admin View, there is a place called 'Settings'. If you scroll down a little, there is a place where you can create Tabs. Any amount of Tabs may be created. Let's say 'Many' click save, then you have 4 Tabs.  Save those Tabs because if it is not saved they are not in the database. Then go to the fields(Editing the Admin Field)

### Tabs Menu - Dropdown

In the Tabs menu, all those Tabs will be a dropdown. On the other side, if there are no Tabs setup, and if the Fields are opened, it will have no Tabs. It only shows Details.

To have more than Details as an option for Tabs, you need to add in the Settings area. There is a place which says Tab Setup Options. Click on the plus'+' sign, and add your Settings.
