# GLOBAL SETTINGS OF COMPONENT BUILDER

### Options Button For Global Configurations

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LA2WDi8G79E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Open 'Component Builder Dashboard.' It's accessible through 'Options' button. Only users with permission will be able to see 'Options'; if they are in a different group than the global administrator 'Options' will not be visible. [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m41s) These permissional structures can be changed as needed. Click 'options' and 'Component Builder configurations' will open. Here are some important switches. These areas can be added to your details if you want it displayed in the components front-end. (See video.)

### Check-In Timer

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LA2WDi8G79E?start=76" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The option 'Check-in timer' to check-in items is built into Component Builder. Here can be checked if an item has been locked out for five hours; it brings it back in twelve hours, twenty-four hours, every second day, once a week, or never. The check-in timer is set here. (See video.) [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m47s)

### Enable Version

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LA2WDi8G79E?start=115" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The version can be disabled by clicking 'no', or enabled by 'yes'. The number of versions that have to be kept of the item may be set. If '0' is set, all versions will be saved. It can be limited to prevent your system from overloading with data in the database. [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m17s)

### Minify JS(JavaScript)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LA2WDi8G79E?start=145" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

All the JS that have been built in Component Builder can be changed to be 'Minified'. [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m40s) While in production, components can be exported without minifying the JS in the files and the footers of the documents. If minification becomes necessary, click 'yes'. That would minify JS, which is your JavaScript in the component while it's being complied. [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m07s)

### Contributor Info

You can add more contributors here; they will show up in the dashboard underneath contributors.

### UiKit Settings

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LA2WDi8G79E?start=217" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The UiKit settings are primarily for the back end, which is being implemented in certain areas at the moment. Most of the time this is only needed in the front-end framework of the component. VDM added it to Component Builder in case, at some point, it starts adding a front end shop for the components being developed. [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m00s) That's part of front end distributing software that might be designed eventually. You can install this and run it. It is like a factory with a front end. That is still in planning, and as there might be security risks, users are advised to use the Component Builder offline. [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m35s)

### Encryption Settings

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LA2WDi8G79E?start=284" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Component Builder encrypts some of the data in the database at some places. When Basic encryption is used the 'Basic Key' has to be entered. (See video.) Once the key is entered, ensure that you do not change it. This key locks the data and this is the only key that can unlock it; if it is removed it cannot be unlocked. [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m13s)

**Note: It can be removed to prevent unauthorized access to the data in the fields but then it must be saved in another place.**

### Folder Paths

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LA2WDi8G79E?start=342" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Currently, two folder paths can be used: the Backup folder path and the Git folder path. Please read related notation. It is suggested that no changes be made to the Custom folder path and the Compiler folder path at this stage. These fields were added because I envisioned the possibility that these folders have to be moved out of our web area of developing since there are security concerns that these files and folders might be targeted. [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m14s) It has not been fully implemented across the compiler infrastructure, so currently it's best to leave those folders the way they are by not adding any data in it.

### Permissions

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LA2WDi8G79E?start=410" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The permissions structure in Component Builder is not that intense, but there are a lot of permission switches. With the latest Joomla 3.5 release, this permissions structure updating construct is made much easier. There was a problem in the past. The data set of permissions was too big; when saved, the browser froze. Even the server did not want to receive the data set. [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m26s) Now Ajax per field had been added, making this much easier. It means that without clicking save and close, currently changes may be made to the permissions structure and it will immediately be stored in the database. This applies to Joomla 3.5 and later versions. We also want to store these areas: 'Global', 'UiKit Settings', 'Encryption Settings', and 'Folder Paths'. [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m58s) This implementation may not be that accurate, but 'Configure Options Only' is there as permission. It might work by taking a certain group, giving it Configure Options Only 'Access', then logging out of the user. Log in to a user in the group, then this permissions tab will not be visible. [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m26s) Only these 'Global', 'UiKit Settings', 'Encryption Settings', 'Folder Paths' settings in the tabs will be seen. Changes may be made to these and saved without any browser latency or overload. It is possible to come in and tweak the permissions in Global or Super Administrator accordingly. It can be changed in the manager area, 'Select a new setting' column. It does an Ajax storing of the value in the database. [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m02s) There are Global Create, Delete, Edit, Edit State, Edit own, Edit created by, and Edit created date. [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m39s) Then the per View permission structure like Admin view, Custom admin view, the Dynamic get, and different areas where permissions can be changed for groups.

### Example Preacher Permissions

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LA2WDi8G79E?start=605" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The same permission implementation options and structures are available to all components build by Component Builder because the switches are used for the fields as well as certain views. (See video.) [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m30s) Another place of implementation is in Admin views, 'Preacher'. [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m28s) There is the permissions structure for 'edit'. Select 'view and it will use the view name; select 'core and it will fall back on the Core edit and delete features corresponding. If 'view.edit' is used an edit switch with this view's name, 'preacher.edit', will be seen in the permissions structure. [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m51s)  If 'core.edit' is used, only 'edit', 'delete', or 'create' may be seen (whatever one had been selected.) In relation to each record, this means that it will be added to the record itself. The Edit structure can be tweaked. This is the global setting or for both. That is partly how some of the permissions switches are controlled. The other area is in Fields themselves. [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m25s)

### Field Permission Switch

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LA2WDi8G79E?start=750" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

For example: In the field 'Preacher name' a 'who edit?' the switch can be used to prevent anyone to edit the field. Currently, a 'who can view?' function is not yet implemented since there are problems with an overload of switches added to the permissions structure. Since Joomla made this change, it might be added. [00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m58s)

* Example See Video

This is how you get a fields permissions switch. [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m23s) For example: In the 'Fields' column click 'Name'. In the 'Permissions' column click 'yes' then save and close. Open the Sermon Distributor Dashboard and its options. Go to the permissions tab; scroll down to where the Help Documents can be seen. There is 'Preacher'. (See video.) [00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m49s) Preacher has site access; access to Preacher itself, 'batch', 'create', 'dashboard add', 'dashboard list', 'delete', 'edit', 'edit created by', 'edit created date', 'edit own', 'edit state', 'edit version', 'export', 'import', and 'submenu'. Then it starts with Series. As it doesn't show 'name' here yet go back to Component Builder, Compiler, select Sermon Distributor, and compile it. Once it's completed, click on 'Install' to do a quick install. [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m27s) If that is completed go back to the configuration and refresh the page. (Click refresh at the top.) Scroll down and find the new field, 'Preacher edit name'. Decide whether this group can edit the 'name', whether it's denied, or inherited? The permissions structure per field can be added in this way. Go back and revert it if you do not want the area to be monitored. [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m07s) Go back and open 'Preacher'. Back to the fields. Click 'no'. Save and close. Open Compiler. Select Sermon Distributor, compile and install it. Go back to 'refresh'. The field is gone. It's no longer being controlled by the permissions infrastructure. [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h15m41s) This way it is possible to determine which group can access what fields or what views are accessible through the permissions structures. You can integrate the permissions, not only per view but per field in a view, as well as the normal control relating to a specific view. [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m07s) It also adds permissions to every item; an item may be overridden to make it impossible for a group to access the field. [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2WDi8G79E&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h16m50s)
